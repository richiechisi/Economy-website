<h3>Economic Problems. What is affecting our economy? Here are some of the major problems affecting our economy today.
Inflation Rate. What is Inflation Rate and how does it affect us? Inflation is the rate of increase in prices over a given
period of time. Inflation in the Philippines as of March 2023 is 7.6% so it has decreased because the chart of inflation as of 
January 2023 was 8.7%. So how does it affect us? For example if we talk about the price of onions in the Philippines. The price 
of onions became overpriced with an amount of 250 pesos per kilograms and this has become an issue because of the price of onions.</h3>
<h3>Poverty. Poverty has been a very big problem to our economy with a rapid increase within it. Why is poverty a problem? Poverty 
demands the lack of income and productive resources to ensure sustainable livelihoods. How is it a problem in the economy? The higher 
rate of poverty, the lower the rate of unemployment. Many report are saying that poverty is positive in unemployment rate. Poverty
is a state of an individual who lacks the financial means to cover basic living expenses. It also limits the access to educational
and employment oppurtunities because the Philippines education system requires significant improvement to meet the demands of the
modern economy. Many filipinos lack the skills needed for high paying jobs limiting their economic potential.</h3> <h3>Agriculture. Agriculture is
a crtical issue in the Philippines, but it faces several challenges such as low productivity, insufficient infrastructure and natural 
disasters. Our agricultural sector needs more investment to increase the country's productivity and improve food security.</h3>

<h3>Overall, these economic problems needs more investment and changes to address the situation effectively. The goverment, Private sectors
and the community need to work together to address all the issue and improve the country's economy.</h3>
