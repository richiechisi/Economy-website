<h3>How does poverty affect the economy of a country? Lacks of economic oppurtunity leads to impoverishment which leads to crime.
there are many reasons why poverty happens in a country but here are some of the problems. Unemployment/Underemployment. For
the poor, Labour is often the only asset they can use to improve their well being. Productive  employment oppurtinities helps in
decreasing  poverty and have a sustainable  economic and social development. The philippines has a high unemployment rate,
and many of those have jobs are underemployed, meaning they are not earning enough to lift them and their family to leave poverty.</h3>

<h3>Natural Disaster. All though you're wondering  why is it here, it is actually common since many storms are always coming to the
Philippines. The Philippines is prone to natural disasters like typhoons, floods, and earthquakes, which can devastate communities
and make people poor by destroying homes and livelihoods.</h3>

<h3>Income Inequality. There is a significant inequality between rich and poor in the Philippines, with small percentage of the
population controlling very large amount of the country's wealth making it hard for poor people to get enough money to sustain
their access to basic living essentials.</h3>
