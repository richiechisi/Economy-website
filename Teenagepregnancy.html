<h3>Teenage pregnancy is a very hot topic in the Philippines and has been circulating social media these days. So what is
Teenage Pregnancy and why is it important to not discriminate them? There are many reasons why teenage pregnancy happens so
it is important that we should not discriminate them because sometimes we don't know the reason why they got pregnant. There are
many reasons why teenage pregnancy should not be normalized nor discriminated. Teenagers cannot afford paying the expenses for 
their children so that is the reason why parents are obligated to keep their childs baby as their own and pay for the expenses.
This is why parents are sometimes being financially unstable especially if the family of the teen is not rich and just can afford
basic living expenses. Sometimes teenage pregnancy happens because of rape and this is a problem for the teenagers mental health
because it is very hard to be raped and also baring the child of your raping, and abortion is not legal in the Philippnes which
is very hard for the girl because they have no choice but to face the consequences even if its not their fault.</h3>
