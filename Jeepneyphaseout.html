<h3>Traditional Jeepneys are very important to us because it has been around for many decades and has been our number 1
transportation throughout the years. But for the past years jeepneys are one of the causes of air pollution in the philippines
so the goverment is planning to modernize it to less down the air pollution. But the amount of the modernized jeep is very high
so if our jeepney drivers would buy one they would go into high debt. The price of a modern jeepney is around 2-2.6 million and if jeepney
drivers would sell their jeepney it would only cost 150k-250k so it is still not enough to buy one. Many people are also against
the jeepney phaseout because it would only worsen the situation if they proceeded to phaseout all jeepneys because many jeepney
drivers would lose jobs and we should also think that drivers are underpaid even though they work for many hours everyday
and all that money goes to their family and house expenses and sometimes not enough to pay for it. The jeepney phaseout would 
only be a problem not only because many drivers would be poor but also beause we loss one of our tradition and also there would be less
transportation so it would be hard for transporters to find transportations and most of them are students.</h3>
