think, decide, and many more basic things, but if we are going to talk about education we should know how it is important for to work,
find proper jobs and how it affects us. Education is considered one of the most important sectors in the Philippines, with our goverment
heavily investing in education to ensure that every filipino has access to quality education. The country has a 10 year educational system
which composed of six years in elementary, 4 years in junior high and 2 years in senior high which is k-12. The Philippines education system
requires significant improvement to meet the demands of the modern economy. Filipinos needs to meet the standard for high paying
jobs and to sustain a better living.</h3>
